## Description
This project was undertaken to create a command-line application that quickly generates a quality README file. It takes into account the usual components of a README file (title, description, installation, usage, license, contributing, and questions) and allows the user of the application to enter their content via Node.js utilizing inquirer. The structure of the generated README file is as demonstrated here.

## Usage
